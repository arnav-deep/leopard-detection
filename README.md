# Leopard Detection
Leopard detection is done through Custom Object Detection using YOLO. Darkflow simplifies the use of YOLO and makes custom object detection simple and easier. Step-by-step how to use Darkflow can be found here [here](https://github.com/Boltuzamaki/Custom-Object-Detection-Using-Darkflow-Simplified-).

## The Motivation
IIITDM Jabalpur campus is located right beside Dumna Nature Reserve. Dumna Nature Reserve is home to many faunae. Out of all of the faunae, Leopards and Deer have frequented the campus by jumping over the boundary walls. These Leopards pose a threat to the other rsidents of the lush green campus.

To make an IoT device that would alert authorities and people nearby about the prresence of a leopard, Custom Object Detection is used.
